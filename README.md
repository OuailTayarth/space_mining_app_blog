# Astrolith: Empowering Women In Space Through Digital Art

Astrolith is a full-stack application built with React on the front end and blockchain on the back end for storing data. It uses digital art to raise awareness about space resource utilization while celebrating black women in the space industry. The app and its blog work together to show how off-world solutions can solve Earthâ€™s problems, like racial inequity and natural resource depletion. The blog shares news, publications, and stories, especially about women in space, to inspire future galactic pioneers and ambassadors.

## Reason for Building This App

I built this project during my last role as a front-end developer at Rose Law Group, the company I was working at. To promote gender and racial diversity in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math). By highlighting black women in the space industry and the potential of space resources, Astrolith aims to empower and inspire the next generation of innovators and leaders
